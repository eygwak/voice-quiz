Realtime API
============

Build low-latency, multimodal LLM applications with the Realtime API.

The OpenAI Realtime API enables low-latency communication with [models](/docs/models) that natively support speech-to-speech interactions as well as multimodal inputs (audio, images, and text) and outputs (audio and text). These APIs can also be used for [realtime audio transcription](/docs/guides/realtime-transcription).

Voice agents
------------

One of the most common use cases for the Realtime API is building voice agents for speech-to-speech model interactions in the browser. Our recommended starting point for these types of applications is the [Agents SDK for TypeScript](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/), which uses a [WebRTC connection](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) to the Realtime model in the browser, and [WebSocket](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket) when used on the server.

```js
import { RealtimeAgent, RealtimeSession } from "@openai/agents/realtime";

const agent = new RealtimeAgent({
    name: "Assistant",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
});

const session = new RealtimeSession(agent);

// Automatically connects your microphone and audio output
await session.connect({
    apiKey: "<client-api-key>",
});
```

Voice Agent Quickstart

Follow the voice agent quickstart to build Realtime agents in the browser.

To use the Realtime API directly outside the context of voice agents, check out the other connection options below.

Connection methods
------------------

While building [voice agents with the Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/) is the fastest path to one specific type of application, the Realtime API provides an entire suite of flexible tools for a variety of use cases.

There are three primary supported interfaces for the Realtime API:

[

WebRTC connection

Ideal for browser and client-side interactions with a Realtime model.

](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc)[

WebSocket connection

Ideal for middle tier server-side applications with consistent low-latency network connections.

](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket)[

SIP connection

Ideal for VoIP telephony connections.

](/docs/guides/realtime-sip)

Depending on how you'd like to connect to a Realtime model, check out one of the connection guides above to get started. You'll learn how to initialize a Realtime session, and how to interact with a Realtime model using client and server events.

API Usage
---------

Once connected to a realtime model using one of the methods above, learn how to interact with the model in these usage guides.

Beta to GA migration
--------------------

There are a few key differences between the interfaces in the Realtime beta API and the recently released GA API. Expand the topics below for more information about migrating from the beta interface to GA.

Beta header

For REST API requests, WebSocket connections, and other interfaces with the Realtime API, beta users had to include the following header with each request:

```text
OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1
```

This header should be removed for requests to the GA interface. To retain the behavior of the beta API, you should continue to include this header.

Generating ephemeral API keys

In the beta interface, there were multiple endpoints for generating ephemeral keys for either Realtime sessions or transcription sessions. In the GA interface, there is only one REST API endpoint used to generate keys - [`POST /v1/realtime/client_secrets`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions/create-realtime-client-secret).

To create a session and receive a client secret you can use to initialize a WebRTC or WebSocket connection on a client, you can request one like this using the appropriate session configuration:

```javascript
const sessionConfig = JSON.stringify({
    session: {
        type: "realtime",
        model: "gpt-realtime",
        audio: {
            output: { voice: "marin" },
        },
    },
});

const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: sessionConfig,
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.value); // e.g. ek_68af296e8e408191a1120ab6383263c2
```

These tokens can safely be used in client environments like browsers and mobile applications.

New URL for WebRTC SDP data

When initializing a WebRTC session in the browser, the URL for obtaining remote session information via SDP is now `/v1/realtime/calls`:

```javascript
const baseUrl = "https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls";
const model = "gpt-realtime";
const sdpResponse = await fetch(baseUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    body: offer.sdp,
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_EPHEMERAL_KEY_HERE`,
        "Content-Type": "application/sdp",
    },
});

const sdp = await sdpResponse.text();
const answer = { type: "answer", sdp };
await pc.setRemoteDescription(answer);
```

New event names and shapes

When creating or [updating](/docs/api-reference/realtime_client_events/session/update) a Realtime session in the GA interface, you must now specify a session type, since now the same client event is used to create both speech-to-speech and transcription sessions. The options for the session type are:

*   `realtime` for speech-to-speech
*   `transcription` for realtime audio transcription

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";

const url = "wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-realtime";
const ws = new WebSocket(url, {
    headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer " + process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    },
});

ws.on("open", function open() {
    console.log("Connected to server.");

    // Send client events over the WebSocket once connected
    ws.send(
        JSON.stringify({
            type: "session.update",
            session: {
                type: "realtime",
                instructions: "Be extra nice today!",
            },
        })
    );
});
```

Configuration for input modalities and other properties have moved as well, notably output audio configuration like model voice. [Check the API reference](/docs/api-reference/realtime_client_events) for the latest event shapes.

```javascript
ws.on("open", function open() {
    ws.send(
        JSON.stringify({
            type: "session.update",
            session: {
                type: "realtime",
                model: "gpt-realtime",
                audio: {
                    output: { voice: "marin" },
                },
            },
        })
    );
});
```

Finally, some event names have changed to reflect their new position in the event data model:

*   **`response.text.delta` → `response.output_text.delta`**
*   **`response.audio.delta` → `response.output_audio.delta`**
*   **`response.audio_transcript.delta` → `response.output_audio_transcript.delta`**

New conversation item events

For `response.output_item`, the API has always had both `.added` and `.done` events, but for conversation level items the API previously only had `.created`, which by convention is emitted at the start when the item added.

We have added a `.added` and `.done` event to allow better ergonomics for developers when receiving events that need some loading time (such as MCP tool listing or input audio transcriptions if these were to be modeled as items in the future).

Current event shape for conversation items added:

```javascript
{
    "event_id": "event_1920",
    "type": "conversation.item.created",
    "previous_item_id": "msg_002",
    "item": Item
}
```

New events to replace the above:

```javascript
{
    "event_id": "event_1920",
    "type": "conversation.item.added",
    "previous_item_id": "msg_002",
    "item": Item
}
```

```javascript
{
    "event_id": "event_1920",
    "type": "conversation.item.done",
    "previous_item_id": "msg_002",
    "item": Item
}
```

Input and output item changes

### All Items

Realtime API sets an `object=realtime.item` param on all items in the GA interface.

### Function Call Output

`status` : Realtime now accepts a no-op `status` field for the function call output item param. This aligns with the Responses API implementation.

### Message

**Assistant Message Content**

The `type` properties of output assistant messages now align with the Responses API:

*   `type=text` → `type=output_text` (no change to `text` field name)
*   `type=audio` → `type=output_audio` (no change to `audio` field name)

Realtime API with WebRTC
========================

Connect to the Realtime API using WebRTC.

[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) is a powerful set of standard interfaces for building real-time applications. The OpenAI Realtime API supports connecting to realtime models through a WebRTC peer connection.

For browser-based speech-to-speech voice applications, we recommend starting with the [Agents SDK for TypeScript](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/quickstart/), which provides higher-level helpers and APIs for managing Realtime sessions. The WebRTC interface is powerful and flexible, but lower level than the Agents SDK.

When connecting to a Realtime model from the client (like a web browser or mobile device), we recommend using WebRTC rather than WebSockets for more consistent performance.

For more guidance on building user interfaces on top of WebRTC, [refer to the docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).

Overview
--------

The Realtime API supports two mechanisms for connecting to the Realtime API from the browser, either using ephemeral API keys ([generated via the OpenAI REST API](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions)), or via the new unified interface. Generally, using the unified interface is simpler, but puts your application server in the critical path for session initialization.

### Connecting using the unified interface

The process for initializing a WebRTC connection using the unified interface is as follows (assuming a web browser client):

1.  The browser makes a request to a developer-controlled server using the SDP data from its WebRTC peer connection.
2.  The server combines that SDP with its session configuration in a multipart form and sends that to the OpenAI Realtime API, authenticating it with its [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys).

#### Creating a session via the unified interface

To create a realtime API session via the unified interface, you will need to build a small server-side application (or integrate with an existing one) to make an request to `/v1/realtime/calls`. You will use a [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys) to authenticate this request on your backend server.

Below is an example of a simple Node.js [express](https://expressjs.com/) server which creates a realtime API session:

```javascript
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// Parse raw SDP payloads posted from the browser
app.use(express.text({ type: ["application/sdp", "text/plain"] }));

const sessionConfig = JSON.stringify({
    type: "realtime",
    model: "gpt-realtime",
    audio: { output: { voice: "marin" } }
});

// An endpoint which creates a Realtime API session.
app.post("/session", async (req, res) => {
    const fd = new FormData();
    fd.set("sdp", req.body);
    fd.set("session", sessionConfig);

    try {
        const r = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
            },
            body: fd,
        });
        // Send back the SDP we received from the OpenAI REST API
        const sdp = await r.text();
        res.send(sdp);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Token generation error:", error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to generate token" });
    }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Connecting to the server

In the browser, you can use standard WebRTC APIs to connect to the Realtime API via your application server. The client directly POSTs its SDP data to your server.

```javascript
// Create a peer connection
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

// Set up to play remote audio from the model
audioElement.current = document.createElement("audio");
audioElement.current.autoplay = true;
pc.ontrack = (e) => (audioElement.current.srcObject = e.streams[0]);

// Add local audio track for microphone input in the browser
const ms = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: true,
});
pc.addTrack(ms.getTracks()[0]);

// Set up data channel for sending and receiving events
const dc = pc.createDataChannel("oai-events");

// Start the session using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
const offer = await pc.createOffer();
await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);

const sdpResponse = await fetch("/session", {
    method: "POST",
    body: offer.sdp,
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/sdp",
    },
});

const answer = {
    type: "answer",
    sdp: await sdpResponse.text(),
};
await pc.setRemoteDescription(answer);
```

### Connecting using an ephemeral token

The process for initializing a WebRTC connection using an ephemeral API key is as follows (assuming a web browser client):

1.  The browser makes a request to a developer-controlled server to mint an ephemeral API key.
2.  The developer's server uses a [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys) to request an ephemeral key from the [OpenAI REST API](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions), and returns that new key to the browser.
3.  The browser uses the ephemeral key to authenticate a session directly with the OpenAI Realtime API as a [WebRTC peer connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection).

![connect to realtime via WebRTC](https://openaidevs.retool.com/api/file/55b47800-9aaf-48b9-90d5-793ab227ddd3)

#### Creating an ephemeral token

To create an ephemeral token to use on the client-side, you will need to build a small server-side application (or integrate with an existing one) to make an [OpenAI REST API](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions) request for an ephemeral key. You will use a [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys) to authenticate this request on your backend server.

Below is an example of a simple Node.js [express](https://expressjs.com/) server which mints an ephemeral API key using the REST API:

```javascript
import express from "express";

const app = express();

const sessionConfig = JSON.stringify({
    session: {
        type: "realtime",
        model: "gpt-realtime",
        audio: {
            output: {
                voice: "marin",
            },
        },
    },
});

// An endpoint which would work with the client code above - it returns
// the contents of a REST API request to this protected endpoint
app.get("/token", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(
            "https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets",
            {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                },
                body: sessionConfig,
            }
        );

        const data = await response.json();
        res.json(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Token generation error:", error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to generate token" });
    }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

You can create a server endpoint like this one on any platform that can send and receive HTTP requests. Just ensure that **you only use standard OpenAI API keys on the server, not in the browser.**

#### Connecting to the server

In the browser, you can use standard WebRTC APIs to connect to the Realtime API with an ephemeral token. The client first fetches a token from your server endpoint, and then POSTs its SDP data (with the ephemeral token) to the Realtime API.

```javascript
// Get a session token for OpenAI Realtime API
const tokenResponse = await fetch("/token");
const data = await tokenResponse.json();
const EPHEMERAL_KEY = data.value;

// Create a peer connection
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

// Set up to play remote audio from the model
audioElement.current = document.createElement("audio");
audioElement.current.autoplay = true;
pc.ontrack = (e) => (audioElement.current.srcObject = e.streams[0]);

// Add local audio track for microphone input in the browser
const ms = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: true,
});
pc.addTrack(ms.getTracks()[0]);

// Set up data channel for sending and receiving events
const dc = pc.createDataChannel("oai-events");

// Start the session using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
const offer = await pc.createOffer();
await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);

const sdpResponse = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls", {
    method: "POST",
    body: offer.sdp,
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${EPHEMERAL_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/sdp",
    },
});

const answer = {
    type: "answer",
    sdp: await sdpResponse.text(),
};
await pc.setRemoteDescription(answer);
```

Sending and receiving events
----------------------------

Realtime API sessions are managed using a combination of [client-sent events](/docs/api-reference/realtime_client_events/session) emitted by you as the developer, and [server-sent events](/docs/api-reference/realtime_server_events/error) created by the Realtime API to indicate session lifecycle events.

When connecting to a Realtime model via WebRTC, you don't have to handle audio events from the model in the same granular way you must with [WebSockets](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket). The WebRTC peer connection object, if configured as above, will do all that work for you.

To send and receive other client and server events, you can use the WebRTC peer connection's [data channel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_data_channels).

```javascript
// This is the data channel set up in the browser code above...
const dc = pc.createDataChannel("oai-events");

// Listen for server events
dc.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
    const event = JSON.parse(e.data);
    console.log(event);
});

// Send client events
const event = {
    type: "conversation.item.create",
    item: {
        type: "message",
        role: "user",
        content: [
            {
                type: "input_text",
                text: "hello there!",
            },
        ],
    },
};
dc.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

Using realtime models
=====================

Use realtime models and prompting effectively.

Realtime models are post-trained for specific customer use cases. In response to your feedback, the latest speech-to-speech model works differently from previous models. Use this guide to understand and get the most out of it.

Meet the models
---------------

Our most advanced speech-to-speech model is [gpt-realtime](/docs/models/gpt-realtime).

This model shows improvements in following complex instructions, calling tools, and producing speech that sounds natural and expressive. For more information, see the [announcement blog post](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/).

Update your session to use a prompt
-----------------------------------

After you initiate a session over [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc), [WebSocket](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket), or [SIP](/docs/guides/realtime-sip), the client and model are connected. The server will send a [session.created](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/created) event to confirm. Now it's a matter of prompting.

### Basic prompt update

1.  Create a basic audio prompt in [the dashboard](/audio/realtime).
    
    If you don't know where to start, experiment with the prompt fields until you find something interesting. You can always manage, iterate on, and version your prompts later.
    
2.  Update your realtime session to use the prompt you created. Provide its prompt ID in a `session.update` client event:
    

Update the system instructions used by the model in this session

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "session.update",
  session: {
      type: "realtime",
      model: "gpt-realtime",
      // Lock the output to audio (set to ["text"] if you want text without audio)
      output_modalities: ["audio"],
      audio: {
        input: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcm",
            rate: 24000,
          },
          turn_detection: {
            type: "semantic_vad"
          }
        },
        output: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcm",
          },
          voice: "marin",
        }
      },
      // Use a server-stored prompt by ID. Optionally pin a version and pass variables.
      prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_123",          // your stored prompt ID
        version: "89",           // optional: pin a specific version
        variables: {
          city: "Paris"          // example variable used by your prompt
        }
      },
      // You can still set direct session fields; these override prompt fields if they overlap:
      instructions: "Speak clearly and briefly. Confirm understanding before taking actions."
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "session.update",
    session: {
      type: "realtime",
      model: "gpt-realtime",
      # Lock the output to audio (add "text" if you also want text)
      output_modalities: ["audio"],
      audio: {
        input: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcm",
            rate: 24000,
          },
          turn_detection: {
            type: "semantic_vad"
          }
        },
        output: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcmu",
          },
          voice: "marin",
        }
      },
      # Use a server-stored prompt by ID. Optionally pin a version and pass variables.
      prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_123",          // your stored prompt ID
        version: "89",           // optional: pin a specific version
        variables: {
          city: "Paris"          // example variable used by your prompt
        }
      },
      # You can still set direct session fields; these override prompt fields if they overlap:
      instructions: "Speak clearly and briefly. Confirm understanding before taking actions."
    }
}
ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

When the session's updated, the server emits a [session.updated](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/updated) event with the new state of the session. You can update the session any time.

### Changing prompt mid-call

To update the session mid-call (to swap prompt version or variables, or override instructions), send the update over the same data channel you're using:

```javascript
// Example: switch to a specific prompt version and change a variable
dc.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "session.update",
  session: {
    type: "realtime",
    prompt: {
      id: "pmpt_123",
      version: "89",
      variables: {
        city: "Berlin"
      }
    }
  }
}));

// Example: override instructions (note: direct session fields take precedence over Prompt fields)
dc.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "session.update",
  session: {
    type: "realtime",
    instructions: "Speak faster and keep answers under two sentences."
  }
}));
```

Prompting gpt-realtime
----------------------

Here are top tips for prompting the realtime speech-to-speech model. For a more in-depth guide to prompting, see the [realtime prompting cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide).

### General usage tips

*   **Iterate relentlessly**. Small wording changes can make or break behavior.
    
    Example: Swapping “inaudible” → “unintelligible” improved noisy input handling.
    
*   **Use bullets over paragraphs**. Clear, short bullets outperform long paragraphs.
    
*   **Guide with examples**. The model strongly follows onto sample phrases.
    
*   **Be precise**. Ambiguity and conflicting instructions degrade performance, similar to GPT-5.
    
*   **Control language**. Pin output to a target language if you see drift.
    
*   **Reduce repetition**. Add a variety rule to reduce robotic phrasing.
    
*   **Use all caps for emphasis**: Capitalize key rules to makes them stand out to the model.
    
*   **Convert non-text rules to text**: The model responds better to clearly written text.
    
    Example: Instead of writing, "IF x > 3 THEN ESCALATE", write, "IF MORE THAN THREE FAILURES THEN ESCALATE."
    

### Structure your prompt

Organize your prompt to help the model understand context and stay consistent across turns.

Use clear, labeled sections in your system prompt so the model can find and follow them. Keep each section focused on one thing.

```markdown
# Role & Objective        — who you are and what “success” means
# Personality & Tone      — the voice and style to maintain
# Context                 — retrieved context, relevant info
# Reference Pronunciations — phonetic guides for tricky words
# Tools                   — names, usage rules, and preambles
# Instructions / Rules    — do’s, don’ts, and approach
# Conversation Flow       — states, goals, and transitions
# Safety & Escalation     — fallback and handoff logic
```

This format also makes it easier for you to iterate and modify problematic sections.

To make this system prompt your own, add domain-specific sections (e.g., Compliance, Brand Policy) and remove sections you don’t need. In each section, provide instructions and other information for the model to respond correctly. See specifics below.

Practical tips for prompting realtime models
--------------------------------------------

Here are 10 tips for creating effective, consistently performing prompts with gpt-realtime. These are just an overview. For more details and full system prompt examples, see the [realtime prompting cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide).

#### 1\. Be precise. Kill conflicts.

The new realtime model is very good at instruction following. However, that also means small wording changes or unclear instructions can shift behavior in meaningful ways. Inspect and iterate on your system prompt to try different phrasing and fix instruction contradictions.

In one experiment we ran, changing the word "inaudible" to "unintelligble" in instructions for handling noisy inputs significantly improved the model's performance.

After your first attempt at a system prompt, have an LLM review it for ambiguity or conflicts.

#### 2\. Bullets > paragraphs.

Realtime models follow short bullet points better than long paragraphs.

Before (harder to follow):

```markdown
When you can’t clearly hear the user, don’t proceed. If there’s background noise or you only caught part of the sentence, pause and ask them politely to repeat themselves in their preferred language, and make sure you keep the conversation in the same language as the user.
```

After (easier to follow):

```markdown
Only respond to clear audio or text.

If audio is unclear/partial/noisy/silent, ask for clarification in `{preferred_language}`.

Continue in the same language as the user if intelligible.
```

#### 3\. Handle unclear audio.

The realtime model is good at following instructions on how to handle unclear audio. Spell out what to do when audio isn’t usable.

```markdown
## Unclear audio
- Always respond in the same language the user is speaking in, if intelligible.
- Default to English if the input language is unclear.
- Only respond to clear audio or text.
- If the user's audio is not clear (e.g., ambiguous input/background noise/silent/unintelligible) or if you did not fully hear or understand the user, ask for clarification using {preferred_language} phrases.

Sample clarification phrases (parameterize with {preferred_language}):

- “Sorry, I didn’t catch that—could you say it again?”
- “There’s some background noise. Please repeat the last part.”
- “I only heard part of that. What did you say after ___?”
```

#### 4\. Constrain the model to one language.

If you see the model switching languages in an unhelpful way, add a dedicated "Language" section in your prompt. Make sure it doesn’t conflict with other rules. By default, mirroring the user’s language works well.

Here's a simple way to mirror the user's language:

```markdown
## Language
Language matching: Respond in the same language as the user unless directed otherwise.
For non-English, start with the same standard accent/dialect the user uses.
```

Here's an example of an English-only constraint:

```markdown
## Language
- The conversation will be only in English.
- Do not respond in any other language, even if the user asks.
- If the user speaks another language, politely explain that support is limited to English.
```

In a language teaching application, your language and conversation sections might look like this:

```markdown
## Language
### Explanations
Use English when explaining grammar, vocabulary, or cultural context.

### Conversation
Speak in French when conducting practice, giving examples, or engaging in dialogue.
```

You can also control dialect for a more consistent personality:

```markdown
## Language
Response only in argentine spanish.
```

#### 5\. Provide sample phrases and flow snippets.

The model learns style from examples. Give short, varied samples for common conversation moments.

For example, you might give this high-level shape of conversation flow to the model:

```markdown
Greeting → Discover → Verify → Diagnose → Resolve → Confirm/Close. Advance only when criteria in each phase are met.
```

And then provide prompt guidance for each section. For example, here's how you might instruct for the greeting section:

```markdown
## Conversation flow — Greeting
Goal: Set tone and invite the reason for calling.

How to respond:
- Identify as ACME Internet Support.
- Keep it brief; invite the caller’s goal.

Sample phrases (vary, don’t always reuse):
- “Thanks for calling ACME Internet—how can I help today?”
- “You’ve reached ACME Support. What’s going on with your service?”
- “Hi there—tell me what you’d like help with.”

Exit when: Caller states an initial goal or symptom.
```

#### 6\. Avoid robotic repetition.

If responses sound repetitive or robotic, include an explicit variety instruction. This can sometimes happen when using sample phrases.

```markdown
## Variety
- Do not repeat the same sentence twice. Vary your responses so it doesn't sound robotic.
```

#### 7\. Use capitalized text to emphasize instructions.

Like many LLMs, using capitalization for important rules can help the model to understand and follow those rules. It's also helpful to convert non-text rules (such as numerical conditions) into text before capitalization.

Instead of:

```markdown
## Rules
- If [func.return_value] > 0, respond 1 to the user.
```

Use:

```markdown
## Rules
- IF [func.return_value] IS BIGGER THAN 0, RESPOND 1 TO THE USER.
```

#### 8\. Help the model use tools.

The model's use of tools can alter the experience—how much they rely on user confirmation vs. taking action, what they say while they make the tool call, which rules they follow for each specific tool, etc.

One way to prompt for tool usage is to use preambles. Good preambles instruct the model to give the user some feedback about what it's doing before it makes the tool call, so the user always knows what's going on.

Here's an example:

```markdown
# Tools
- Before any tool call, say one short line like “I’m checking that now.” Then call the tool immediately.
```

You can include sample phrases for preambles to add variety and better tailor to your use case.

There are several other ways to improve the model's behavior when performing tool calls and keeping the conversation going with the user. Ideally, the model is calling the right tools proactively, checking for confirmation for any important write actions, and keeping the user informed along the way. For more specifics, see the [realtime prompting cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide).

#### 9\. Use LLMs to improve your prompt.

LLMs are great at finding what's going wrong in your prompt. Use ChatGPT or the API to get a model's review of your current realtime prompt and get help improving it.

Whether your prompt is working well or not, here's a prompt you can run to get a model's review:

```markdown
## Role & Objective
You are a **Prompt-Critique Expert**.
Examine a user-supplied LLM prompt and surface any weaknesses following the instructions below.

## Instructions
Review the prompt that is meant for an LLM to follow and identify the following issues:
- Ambiguity: Could any wording be interpreted in more than one way?
- Lacking Definitions: Are there any class labels, terms, or concepts that are not defined that might be misinterpreted by an LLM?
- Conflicting, missing, or vague instructions: Are directions incomplete or contradictory?
- Unstated assumptions: Does the prompt assume the model has to be able to do something that is not explicitly stated?

## Do **NOT** list issues of the following types:
- Invent new instructions, tool calls, or external information. You do not know what tools need to be added that are missing.
- Issues that you are not sure about.

## Output Format

# Issues
- Numbered list; include brief quote snippets.

# Improvements
- Numbered list; provide the revised lines you would change and how you would changed them.

# Revised Prompt
- Revised prompt where you have applied all your improvements surgically with minimal edits to the original prompt
```

Use this template as a starting point for troubleshooting a recurring issue:

```markdown
Here's my current prompt to an LLM:
[BEGIN OF CURRENT PROMPT]
{CURRENT_PROMPT}
[END OF CURRENT PROMPT]

But I see this issue happening from the LLM:
[BEGIN OF ISSUE]
{ISSUE}
[END OF ISSUE]
Can you provide some variants of the prompt so that the model can better understand the constraints to alleviate the issue?
```

#### 10\. Help users resolve issues faster.

Two frustrating user experiences are slow, mechanical voice agents and the inability to escalate. Help users faster by providing instructions in your system prompt for speed and escalation.

In the personality and tone section of your system prompt, add pacing instructions to get the model to quicken its support:

```markdown
# Personality & Tone
## Personality
Friendly, calm and approachable expert customer service assistant.

## Tone
Tone: Warm, concise, confident, never fawning.

## Length
2–3 sentences per turn.

## Pacing
Deliver your audio response fast, but do not sound rushed. Do not modify the content of your response, only increase speaking speed for the same response.
```

Often with realtime voice agents, having a reliable way to escalate to a human is important. In a safety and escalation section, modify the instructions on WHEN to escalate depending on your use case. Here's an example:

```markdown
# Safety & Escalation
When to escalate (no extra troubleshooting):
- Safety risk (self-harm, threats, harassment)
- User explicitly asks for a human
- Severe dissatisfaction (e.g., “extremely frustrated,” repeated complaints, profanity)
- **2** failed tool attempts on the same task **or** **3** consecutive no-match/no-input events
- Out-of-scope or restricted (e.g., real-time news, financial/legal/medical advice)

What to say at the same time of calling the escalate_to_human tool (MANDATORY):
- “Thanks for your patience—**I’m connecting you with a specialist now**.”
- Then call the tool: `escalate_to_human`

Examples that would require escalation:
- “This is the third time the reset didn’t work. Just get me a person.”
- “I am extremely frustrated!”
```

Realtime conversations
======================

Learn how to manage Realtime speech-to-speech conversations.

Once you have connected to the Realtime API through either [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) or [WebSocket](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket), you can call a Realtime model (such as [gpt-realtime](/docs/models/gpt-realtime)) to have speech-to-speech conversations. Doing so will require you to **send client events** to initiate actions, and **listen for server events** to respond to actions taken by the Realtime API.

This guide will walk through the event flows required to use model capabilities like audio and text generation and function calling, and how to think about the state of a Realtime Session.

If you do not need to have a conversation with the model, meaning you don't expect any response, you can use the Realtime API in [transcription mode](/docs/guides/realtime-transcription).

Realtime speech-to-speech sessions
----------------------------------

A Realtime Session is a stateful interaction between the model and a connected client. The key components of the session are:

*   The **Session** object, which controls the parameters of the interaction, like the model being used, the voice used to generate output, and other configuration.
*   A **Conversation**, which represents user input Items and model output Items generated during the current session.
*   **Responses**, which are model-generated audio or text Items that are added to the Conversation.

**Input audio buffer and WebSockets**

If you are using WebRTC, much of the media handling required to send and receive audio from the model is assisted by WebRTC APIs.

  

If you are using WebSockets for audio, you will need to manually interact with the **input audio buffer** by sending audio to the server, sent with JSON events with base64-encoded audio.

All these components together make up a Realtime Session. You will use client events to update the state of the session, and listen for server events to react to state changes within the session.

![diagram realtime state](https://openaidevs.retool.com/api/file/11fe71d2-611e-4a26-a587-881719a90e56)

Session lifecycle events
------------------------

After initiating a session via either [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) or [WebSockets](/docs/guides/realtime-websockets), the server will send a [`session.created`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/created) event indicating the session is ready. On the client, you can update the current session configuration with the [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) event. Most session properties can be updated at any time, except for the `voice` the model uses for audio output, after the model has responded with audio once during the session. The maximum duration of a Realtime session is **60 minutes**.

The following example shows updating the session with a `session.update` client event. See the [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc#sending-and-receiving-events) or [WebSocket](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket#sending-and-receiving-events) guide for more on sending client events over these channels.

Update the system instructions used by the model in this session

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "session.update",
  session: {
      type: "realtime",
      model: "gpt-realtime",
      // Lock the output to audio (set to ["text"] if you want text without audio)
      output_modalities: ["audio"],
      audio: {
        input: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcm",
            rate: 24000,
          },
          turn_detection: {
            type: "semantic_vad"
          }
        },
        output: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcm",
          },
          voice: "marin",
        }
      },
      // Use a server-stored prompt by ID. Optionally pin a version and pass variables.
      prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_123",          // your stored prompt ID
        version: "89",           // optional: pin a specific version
        variables: {
          city: "Paris"          // example variable used by your prompt
        }
      },
      // You can still set direct session fields; these override prompt fields if they overlap:
      instructions: "Speak clearly and briefly. Confirm understanding before taking actions."
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "session.update",
    session: {
      type: "realtime",
      model: "gpt-realtime",
      # Lock the output to audio (add "text" if you also want text)
      output_modalities: ["audio"],
      audio: {
        input: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcm",
            rate: 24000,
          },
          turn_detection: {
            type: "semantic_vad"
          }
        },
        output: {
          format: {
            type: "audio/pcmu",
          },
          voice: "marin",
        }
      },
      # Use a server-stored prompt by ID. Optionally pin a version and pass variables.
      prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_123",          // your stored prompt ID
        version: "89",           // optional: pin a specific version
        variables: {
          city: "Paris"          // example variable used by your prompt
        }
      },
      # You can still set direct session fields; these override prompt fields if they overlap:
      instructions: "Speak clearly and briefly. Confirm understanding before taking actions."
    }
}
ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

When the session has been updated, the server will emit a [`session.updated`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/updated) event with the new state of the session.

||
|session.update|session.createdsession.updated|

Text inputs and outputs
-----------------------

To generate text with a Realtime model, you can add text inputs to the current conversation, ask the model to generate a response, and listen for server-sent events indicating the progress of the model's response. In order to generate text, the [session must be configured](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) with the `text` modality (this is true by default).

Create a new text conversation item using the [`conversation.item.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/conversation/item/create) client event. This is similar to sending a [user message (prompt) in Chat Completions](/docs/guides/text-generation) in the REST API.

Create a conversation item with user input

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "conversation.item.create",
  item: {
    type: "message",
    role: "user",
    content: [
      {
        type: "input_text",
        text: "What Prince album sold the most copies?",
      }
    ]
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "conversation.item.create",
    "item": {
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "input_text",
                "text": "What Prince album sold the most copies?",
            }
        ]
    }
}
ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

After adding the user message to the conversation, send the [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) event to initiate a response from the model. If both audio and text are enabled for the current session, the model will respond with both audio and text content. If you'd like to generate text only, you can specify that when sending the `response.create` client event, as shown below.

Generate a text-only response

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    output_modalities: [ "text" ]
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "response.create",
    "response": {
        "output_modalities": [ "text" ]
    }
}
ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

When the response is completely finished, the server will emit the [`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done) event. This event will contain the full text generated by the model, as shown below.

Listen for response.done to see the final results

```javascript
function handleEvent(e) {
  const serverEvent = JSON.parse(e.data);
  if (serverEvent.type === "response.done") {
    console.log(serverEvent.response.output[0]);
  }
}

// Listen for server messages (WebRTC)
dataChannel.addEventListener("message", handleEvent);

// Listen for server messages (WebSocket)
// ws.on("message", handleEvent);
```

```python
def on_message(ws, message):
    server_event = json.loads(message)
    if server_event.type == "response.done":
        print(server_event.response.output[0])
```

While the model response is being generated, the server will emit a number of lifecycle events during the process. You can listen for these events, such as [`response.output_text.delta`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/output_text/delta), to provide realtime feedback to users as the response is generated. A full listing of the events emitted by there server are found below under **related server events**. They are provided in the rough order of when they are emitted, along with relevant client-side events for text generation.

Audio inputs and outputs
------------------------

One of the most powerful features of the Realtime API is voice-to-voice interaction with the model, without an intermediate text-to-speech or speech-to-text step. This enables lower latency for voice interfaces, and gives the model more data to work with around the tone and inflection of voice input.

### Voice options

Realtime sessions can be configured to use one of several built‑in voices when producing audio output. You can set the `voice` on session creation (or on a `response.create`) to control how the model sounds. Current voice options are `alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `coral`, `echo`, `sage`, `shimmer`, and `verse`. Once the model has emitted audio in a session, the `voice` cannot be modified for that session.

### Handling audio with WebRTC

If you are connecting to the Realtime API using WebRTC, the Realtime API is acting as a [peer connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) to your client. Audio output from the model is delivered to your client as a [remote media stream](/docs/guides/realtime-conversations). Audio input to the model is collected using audio devices ([`getUserMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia)), and media streams are added as tracks to to the peer connection.

The example code from the [WebRTC connection guide](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) shows a basic example of configuring both local and remote audio using browser APIs:

```javascript
// Create a peer connection
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

// Set up to play remote audio from the model
const audioEl = document.createElement("audio");
audioEl.autoplay = true;
pc.ontrack = (e) => (audioEl.srcObject = e.streams[0]);

// Add local audio track for microphone input in the browser
const ms = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: true,
});
pc.addTrack(ms.getTracks()[0]);
```

The snippet above enables simple interaction with the Realtime API, but there's much more that can be done. For more examples of different kinds of user interfaces, check out the [WebRTC samples](https://github.com/webrtc/samples) repository. Live demos of these samples can also be [found here](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/).

Using [media captures and streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API) in the browser enables you to do things like mute and unmute microphones, select which device to collect input from, and more.

### Client and server events for audio in WebRTC

By default, WebRTC clients don't need to send any client events to the Realtime API before sending audio inputs. Once a local audio track is added to the peer connection, your users can just start talking!

However, WebRTC clients still receive a number of server-sent lifecycle events as audio is moving back and forth between client and server over the peer connection. Examples include:

*   When input is sent over the local media track, you will receive [`input_audio_buffer.speech_started`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/input_audio_buffer/speech_started) events from the server.
*   When local audio input stops, you'll receive the [`input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/input_audio_buffer/speech_started) event.
*   You'll receive [delta events for the in-progress audio transcript](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/output_audio_transcript/delta).
*   You'll receive a [`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done) event when the model has transcribed and completed sending a response.

Manipulating WebRTC APIs for media streams may give you all the control you need. However, it may occasionally be necessary to use lower-level interfaces for audio input and output. Refer to the WebSockets section below for more information and a listing of events required for granular audio input handling.

### Handling audio with WebSockets

When sending and receiving audio over a WebSocket, you will have a bit more work to do in order to send media from the client, and receive media from the server. Below, you'll find a table describing the flow of events during a WebSocket session that are necessary to send and receive audio over the WebSocket.

The events below are given in lifecycle order, though some events (like the `delta` events) may happen concurrently.

### Streaming audio input to the server

To stream audio input to the server, you can use the [`input_audio_buffer.append`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/append) client event. This event requires you to send chunks of **Base64-encoded audio bytes** to the Realtime API over the socket. Each chunk cannot exceed 15 MB in size.

The format of the input chunks can be configured either for the entire session, or per response.

*   Session: `session.input_audio_format` in [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update)
*   Response: `response.input_audio_format` in [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create)

Append audio input bytes to the conversation

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import decodeAudio from 'audio-decode';

// Converts Float32Array of audio data to PCM16 ArrayBuffer
function floatTo16BitPCM(float32Array) {
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(float32Array.length * 2);
  const view = new DataView(buffer);
  let offset = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < float32Array.length; i++, offset += 2) {
    let s = Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, float32Array[i]));
    view.setInt16(offset, s < 0 ? s * 0x8000 : s * 0x7fff, true);
  }
  return buffer;
}

// Converts a Float32Array to base64-encoded PCM16 data
base64EncodeAudio(float32Array) {
  const arrayBuffer = floatTo16BitPCM(float32Array);
  let binary = '';
  let bytes = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);
  const chunkSize = 0x8000; // 32KB chunk size
  for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i += chunkSize) {
    let chunk = bytes.subarray(i, i + chunkSize);
    binary += String.fromCharCode.apply(null, chunk);
  }
  return btoa(binary);
}

// Fills the audio buffer with the contents of three files,
// then asks the model to generate a response.
const files = [
  './path/to/sample1.wav',
  './path/to/sample2.wav',
  './path/to/sample3.wav'
];

for (const filename of files) {
  const audioFile = fs.readFileSync(filename);
  const audioBuffer = await decodeAudio(audioFile);
  const channelData = audioBuffer.getChannelData(0);
  const base64Chunk = base64EncodeAudio(channelData);
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'input_audio_buffer.append',
    audio: base64Chunk
  }));
});

ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: 'input_audio_buffer.commit'}));
ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: 'response.create'}));
```

```python
import base64
import json
import struct
import soundfile as sf
from websocket import create_connection

# ... create websocket-client named ws ...

def float_to_16bit_pcm(float32_array):
    clipped = [max(-1.0, min(1.0, x)) for x in float32_array]
    pcm16 = b''.join(struct.pack('<h', int(x * 32767)) for x in clipped)
    return pcm16

def base64_encode_audio(float32_array):
    pcm_bytes = float_to_16bit_pcm(float32_array)
    encoded = base64.b64encode(pcm_bytes).decode('ascii')
    return encoded

    './path/to/sample3.wav'
]

for filename in files:
    data, samplerate = sf.read(filename, dtype='float32')
    channel_data = data[:, 0] if data.ndim > 1 else data
    base64_chunk = base64_encode_audio(channel_data)

    # Send the client event
    event = {
        "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
        "audio": base64_chunk
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

### Send full audio messages

It is also possible to create conversation messages that are full audio recordings. Use the [`conversation.item.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/conversation/item/create) client event to create messages with `input_audio` content.

Create full audio input conversation items

```javascript
const fullAudio = "<a base64-encoded string of audio bytes>";

const event = {
  type: "conversation.item.create",
  item: {
    type: "message",
    role: "user",
    content: [
      {
        type: "input_audio",
        audio: fullAudio,
      },
    ],
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
fullAudio = "<a base64-encoded string of audio bytes>"

event = {
    "type": "conversation.item.create",
    "item": {
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "input_audio",
                "audio": fullAudio,
            }
        ],
    },
}

ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

### Working with audio output from a WebSocket

**To play output audio back on a client device like a web browser, we recommend using WebRTC rather than WebSockets**. WebRTC will be more robust sending media to client devices over uncertain network conditions.

But to work with audio output in server-to-server applications using a WebSocket, you will need to listen for [`response.output_audio.delta`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/output_audio/delta) events containing the Base64-encoded chunks of audio data from the model. You will either need to buffer these chunks and write them out to a file, or maybe immediately stream them to another source like [a phone call with Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/twilio-openai-realtime-api-launch-integration).

Note that the [`response.output_audio.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/output_audio/done) and [`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done) events won't actually contain audio data in them - just audio content transcriptions. To get the actual bytes, you'll need to listen for the [`response.output_audio.delta`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/output_audio/delta) events.

The format of the output chunks can be configured either for the entire session, or per response.

*   Session: `session.audio.output.format` in [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update)
*   Response: `response.audio.output.format` in [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create)

Listen for response.output\_audio.delta events

```javascript
function handleEvent(e) {
  const serverEvent = JSON.parse(e.data);
  if (serverEvent.type === "response.audio.delta") {
    // Access Base64-encoded audio chunks
    // console.log(serverEvent.delta);
  }
}

// Listen for server messages (WebSocket)
ws.on("message", handleEvent);
```

```python
def on_message(ws, message):
    server_event = json.loads(message)
    if server_event.type == "response.audio.delta":
        # Access Base64-encoded audio chunks:
        # print(server_event.delta)
```

Voice activity detection
------------------------

By default, Realtime sessions have **voice activity detection (VAD)** enabled, which means the API will determine when the user has started or stopped speaking and respond automatically.

Read more about how to configure VAD in our [voice activity detection](/docs/guides/realtime-vad) guide.

### Disable VAD

VAD can be disabled by setting `turn_detection` to `null` with the [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) client event. This can be useful for interfaces where you would like to take granular control over audio input, like [push to talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-talk) interfaces.

When VAD is disabled, the client will have to manually emit some additional client events to trigger audio responses:

*   Manually send [`input_audio_buffer.commit`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/commit), which will create a new user input item for the conversation.
*   Manually send [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) to trigger an audio response from the model.
*   Send [`input_audio_buffer.clear`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/clear) before beginning a new user input.

### Keep VAD, but disable automatic responses

If you would like to keep VAD mode enabled, but would just like to retain the ability to manually decide when a response is generated, you can set `turn_detection.interrupt_response` and `turn_detection.create_response` to `false` with the [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) client event. This will retain all the behavior of VAD but not automatically create new Responses. Clients can trigger these manually with a [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) event.

This can be useful for moderation or input validation or RAG patterns, where you're comfortable trading a bit more latency in the interaction for control over inputs.

Create responses outside the default conversation
-------------------------------------------------

By default, all responses generated during a session are added to the session's conversation state (the "default conversation"). However, you may want to generate model responses outside the context of the session's default conversation, or have multiple responses generated concurrently. You might also want to have more granular control over which conversation items are considered while the model generates a response (e.g. only the last N number of turns).

Generating "out-of-band" responses which are not added to the default conversation state is possible by setting the `response.conversation` field to the string `none` when creating a response with the [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) client event.

When creating an out-of-band response, you will probably also want some way to identify which server-sent events pertain to this response. You can provide `metadata` for your model response that will help you identify which response is being generated for this client-sent event.

Create an out-of-band model response

```javascript
const prompt = `
Analyze the conversation so far. If it is related to support, output
"support". If it is related to sales, output "sales".
`;

const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    // Setting to "none" indicates the response is out of band
    // and will not be added to the default conversation
    conversation: "none",

    // Set metadata to help identify responses sent back from the model
    metadata: { topic: "classification" },

    // Set any other available response fields
    output_modalities: [ "text" ],
    instructions: prompt,
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
prompt = """
Analyze the conversation so far. If it is related to support, output
"support". If it is related to sales, output "sales".
"""

event = {
    "type": "response.create",
    "response": {
        # Setting to "none" indicates the response is out of band,
        # and will not be added to the default conversation
        "conversation": "none",

        # Set metadata to help identify responses sent back from the model
        "metadata": { "topic": "classification" },

        # Set any other available response fields
        "output_modalities": [ "text" ],
        "instructions": prompt,
    },
}

ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

Now, when you listen for the [`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done) server event, you can identify the result of your out-of-band response.

Create an out-of-band model response

```javascript
function handleEvent(e) {
  const serverEvent = JSON.parse(e.data);
  if (
    serverEvent.type === "response.done" &&
    serverEvent.response.metadata?.topic === "classification"
  ) {
    // this server event pertained to our OOB model response
    console.log(serverEvent.response.output[0]);
  }
}

// Listen for server messages (WebRTC)
dataChannel.addEventListener("message", handleEvent);

// Listen for server messages (WebSocket)
// ws.on("message", handleEvent);
```

```python
def on_message(ws, message):
    server_event = json.loads(message)
    topic = ""

    # See if metadata is present
    try:
        topic = server_event.response.metadata.topic
    except AttributeError:
        print("topic not set")

    if server_event.type == "response.done" and topic == "classification":
        # this server event pertained to our OOB model response
        print(server_event.response.output[0])
```

### Create a custom context for responses

You can also construct a custom context that the model will use to generate a response, outside the default/current conversation. This can be done using the `input` array on a [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) client event. You can use new inputs, or reference existing input items in the conversation by ID.

Listen for out-of-band model response with custom context

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    conversation: "none",
    metadata: { topic: "pizza" },
    output_modalities: [ "text" ],

    // Create a custom input array for this request with whatever context
    // is appropriate
    input: [
      // potentially include existing conversation items:
      {
        type: "item_reference",
        id: "some_conversation_item_id"
      },
      {
        type: "message",
        role: "user",
        content: [
          {
            type: "input_text",
            text: "Is it okay to put pineapple on pizza?",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "response.create",
    "response": {
        "conversation": "none",
        "metadata": { "topic": "pizza" },
        "output_modalities": [ "text" ],

        # Create a custom input array for this request with whatever
        # context is appropriate
        "input": [
            # potentially include existing conversation items:
            {
                "type": "item_reference",
                "id": "some_conversation_item_id"
            },

            # include new content as well
            {
                "type": "message",
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",
                        "text": "Is it okay to put pineapple on pizza?",
                    }
                ],
            }
        ],
    },
}

ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

### Create responses with no context

You can also insert responses into the default conversation, ignoring all other instructions and context. Do this by setting `input` to an empty array.

Insert no-context model responses into the default conversation

```javascript
const prompt = `
Say exactly the following:
I'm a little teapot, short and stout!
This is my handle, this is my spout!
`;

const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    // An empty input array removes existing context
    input: [],
    instructions: prompt,
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
prompt = """
Say exactly the following:
I'm a little teapot, short and stout!
This is my handle, this is my spout!
"""

event = {
    "type": "response.create",
    "response": {
        # An empty input array removes all prior context
        "input": [],
        "instructions": prompt,
    },
}

ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

Function calling
----------------

The Realtime models also support **function calling**, which enables you to execute custom code to extend the capabilities of the model. Here's how it works at a high level:

1.  When [updating the session](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) or [creating a response](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create), you can specify a list of available functions for the model to call.
2.  If when processing input, the model determines it should make a function call, it will add items to the conversation representing arguments to a function call.
3.  When the client detects conversation items that contain function call arguments, it will execute custom code using those arguments
4.  When the custom code has been executed, the client will create new conversation items that contain the output of the function call, and ask the model to respond.

Let's see how this would work in practice by adding a callable function that will provide today's horoscope to users of the model. We'll show the shape of the client event objects that need to be sent, and what the server will emit in turn.

### Configure callable functions

First, we must give the model a selection of functions it can call based on user input. Available functions can be configured either at the session level, or the individual response level.

*   Session: `session.tools` property in [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update)
*   Response: `response.tools` property in [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create)

Here's an example client event payload for a `session.update` that configures a horoscope generation function, that takes a single argument (the astrological sign for which the horoscope should be generated):

[`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update)

```json
{
    "type": "session.update",
    "session": {
        "tools": [
            {
                "type": "function",
                "name": "generate_horoscope",
                "description": "Give today's horoscope for an astrological sign.",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "sign": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The sign for the horoscope.",
                            "enum": [
                                "Aries",
                                "Taurus",
                                "Gemini",
                                "Cancer",
                                "Leo",
                                "Virgo",
                                "Libra",
                                "Scorpio",
                                "Sagittarius",
                                "Capricorn",
                                "Aquarius",
                                "Pisces"
                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["sign"]
                }
            }
        ],
        "tool_choice": "auto"
    }
}
```

The `description` fields for the function and the parameters help the model choose whether or not to call the function, and what data to include in each parameter. If the model receives input that indicates the user wants their horoscope, it will call this function with a `sign` parameter.

### Detect when the model wants to call a function

Based on inputs to the model, the model may decide to call a function in order to generate the best response. Let's say our application adds the following conversation item with a [`conversation.item.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/conversation/item/create) event and then creates a response:

```json
{
    "type": "conversation.item.create",
    "item": {
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "input_text",
                "text": "What is my horoscope? I am an aquarius."
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Followed by a [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) client event to generate a response:

```json
{
    "type": "response.create"
}
```

Instead of immediately returning a text or audio response, the model will instead generate a response that contains the arguments that should be passed to a function in the developer's application. You can listen for realtime updates to function call arguments using the [`response.function_call_arguments.delta`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/function_call_arguments/delta) server event, but `response.done` will also have the complete data we need to call our function.

[`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done)

```json
{
    "type": "response.done",
    "event_id": "event_AeqLA8iR6FK20L4XZs2P6",
    "response": {
        "object": "realtime.response",
        "id": "resp_AeqL8XwMUOri9OhcQJIu9",
        "status": "completed",
        "status_details": null,
        "output": [
            {
                "object": "realtime.item",
                "id": "item_AeqL8gmRWDn9bIsUM2T35",
                "type": "function_call",
                "status": "completed",
                "name": "generate_horoscope",
                "call_id": "call_sHlR7iaFwQ2YQOqm",
                "arguments": "{\"sign\":\"Aquarius\"}"
            }
        ],
        ...
    }
}
```

In the JSON emitted by the server, we can detect that the model wants to call a custom function:

|Property|Function calling purpose|
|---|---|
|response.output[0].type|When set to function_call, indicates this response contains arguments for a named function call.|
|response.output[0].name|The name of the configured function to call, in this case generate_horoscope|
|response.output[0].arguments|A JSON string containing arguments to the function. In our case, "{\"sign\":\"Aquarius\"}".|
|response.output[0].call_id|A system-generated ID for this function call - you will need this ID to pass a function call result back to the model.|

Given this information, we can execute code in our application to generate the horoscope, and then provide that information back to the model so it can generate a response.

### Provide the results of a function call to the model

Upon receiving a response from the model with arguments to a function call, your application can execute code that satisfies the function call. This could be anything you want, like talking to external APIs or accessing databases.

Once you are ready to give the model the results of your custom code, you can create a new conversation item containing the result via the [`conversation.item.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/conversation/item/create) client event.

```json
{
    "type": "conversation.item.create",
    "item": {
        "type": "function_call_output",
        "call_id": "call_sHlR7iaFwQ2YQOqm",
        "output": "{\"horoscope\": \"You will soon meet a new friend.\"}"
    }
}
```

*   The conversation item type is `function_call_output`
*   `item.call_id` is the same ID we got back in the `response.done` event above
*   `item.output` is a JSON string containing the results of our function call

Once we have added the conversation item containing our function call results, we again emit the [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) event from the client. This will trigger a model response using the data from the function call.

```json
{
    "type": "response.create"
}
```

Error handling
--------------

The [`error`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/error) event is emitted by the server whenever an error condition is encountered on the server during the session. Occasionally, these errors can be traced to a client event that was emitted by your application.

Unlike HTTP requests and responses, where a response is implicitly tied to a request from the client, we need to use an `event_id` property on client events to know when one of them has triggered an error condition on the server. This technique is shown in the code below, where the client attempts to emit an unsupported event type.

```javascript
const event = {
    event_id: "my_awesome_event",
    type: "scooby.dooby.doo",
};

dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

This unsuccessful event sent from the client will emit an error event like the following:

```json
{
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "invalid_value",

```

Interruption and Truncation
---------------------------

In many voice applications the user can interrupt the model while it's speaking. Realtime API handles interruptions when VAD is enabled, in that it detects user speech, cancels the ongoing response, and starts a new one. However in this scenario you will want the model to know where it was interrupted, so it can continue the conversation naturally (for example if the user says "what was that last thing?"). We call this **truncating** the model's last response, i.e. removing the unplayed portion of the model's last response from the conversation.

In WebRTC and SIP connections the server manages a buffer of output audio, and thus knows how much audio has been played at a given moment. The server will automatically truncate unplayed audio when there's a user interruption.

With a WebSocket connection the client manages audio playback, and thus must stop playback and handle truncation. Here's how this procedure works:

1.  The client monitors for new `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` events from the server, which indicate the user has started speaking. The server will automatically cancel any in-progress model response and a `response.cancelled` event will be emitted.
2.  When the client detects this event, it should immediately stop playback of any audio currently being played from the model. It should note how much of the last audio response was played before the interruption.
3.  The client should send a [`conversation.item.truncate`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/conversation/item/truncate) event to remove the unplayed portion of the model's last response from the conversation.

Here's an example:

```json
{
    "type": "conversation.item.truncate",
    "item_id": "item_1234", # this is the item ID of the model's last response
    "content_index": 0,
    "audio_end_ms": 1500 # truncate audio after 1.5 seconds
}
```

What about truncating the transcript as well? The realtime model doesn't have enough information to precisely align transcript and audio, and thus `conversation.item.truncate` will cut the audio at a given place and remove the text transcript for the unplayed portion. This solves the problem of removing unplayed audio but doesn't provide a truncated transcript.

Push-to-talk
------------

Realtime API defaults to using voice activity detection (VAD), which means model responses will be triggered with audio input. You can also do a push-to-talk interaction by disabling VAD and using an application-level gate to control when audio input is sent to the model, for example holding the space-bar down to capture audio, then triggering a response when it's released. For some apps this works surprisingly well -- it gives the users control over interactions, avoids VAD failures, and it feels snappy because we're not waiting for a VAD timeout.

Implementing push-to-talk looks a bit different on WebSockets and WebRTC. In a Realtime API WebSocket connection all events are sent in the same channel and with the same ordering, while a WebRTC connection has separate channels for audio and control events.

### WebSockets

To implement push-to-talk with a WebSocket connection, you'll want the client to stop audio playback, handle interruptions, and kick off a new response. Here's a more detailed procedure:

1.  Turn VAD off by setting `"turn_detection": null` in a [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) event.
2.  On push down, start recording audio on the client.
    1.  If there is an in-progress response from the model, cancel it by sending a [`response.cancel`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/cancel) event.
    2.  If there is is ongoing output playback from the model, stop playback immediately and send an `conversation.item.truncate` event to remove any unplayed audio from the conversation.
3.  On up, send an [`input_audio_buffer.append`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/append) message with the audio to place new audio into the input buffer.
4.  Send an [`input_audio_buffer.commit`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/commit) event, this will commit the audio written to the input buffer and kick off input transcription (if enabled).
5.  Then trigger a response with a [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) event.

### WebRTC and SIP

Implementing push-to-talk with WebRTC is similar but the input audio buffer must be explicitly cleared. Here's a procedure:

1.  Turn VAD off by setting `"turn_detection": null` in a [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) event.
2.  On push down, send an [`input_audio_buffer.clear`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/clear) event to clear any previous audio input.
    1.  If there is an in-progress response from the model, cancel it by sending a [`response.cancel`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/cancel) event.
    2.  If there is is ongoing output playback from the model, send an [`output_audio_buffer.clear`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/output_audio_buffer/clear) event to clear out the unplayed audio, this truncates the conversation as well.
3.  On up, send an [`input_audio_buffer.commit`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/commit) event, this will commit the audio written to the input buffer and kick off input transcription (if enabled).
4.  Then trigger a response with a [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) event.

Webhooks and server-side controls
=================================

Use webhooks and server-side controls with the Realtime API.

The Realtime API allows clients to connect directly to the API server via WebRTC or SIP. However, you'll most likely want tool use and other business logic to reside on your application server to keep this logic private and client-agnostic.

Keep tool use, business logic, and other details secure on the server side by connecting over a “sideband” control channel. We now have sideband options for both SIP and WebRTC connections.

A sideband connection means there are two active connections to the same Realtime session: one from the user's client and one from your application server. The server connection can be used to monitor the session, update instructions, and respond to tool calls.

With WebRTC
-----------

1.  When [establishing a peer connection](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) you fetch and receive an SDP response from the Realtime API to configure the connection. If you used the sample code from the WebRTC guide, that looks something like this:

```javascript
const baseUrl = "https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls";
const sdpResponse = await fetch(baseUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    body: offer.sdp,
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${EPHEMERAL_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/sdp",
    },
});
```

2.  The fetch response will contain a `Location` header that has a unique call ID that can be used on the server to establish a WebSocket connection to that same Realtime session.

```javascript
// Location: /v1/realtime/calls/rtc_123456
const location = sdpResponse.headers.get("Location");
const callId = location?.split("/").pop();
console.log(callId);
```

3.  On a server, you can then [listen for events and configure the session](/docs/guides/realtime-conversations) just as you would from a typical Realtime API WebSocket connection, using that call ID with the URL `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?call_id=rtc_xxxxx`, as shown below:

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";
const callId = "rtc_u1_9c6574da8b8a41a18da9308f4ad974ce";

// Connect to a WebSocket for the in-progress call
const url = "wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?call_id=" + callId;
const ws = new WebSocket(url, {
    headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer " + process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    },
});

ws.on("open", function open() {
    console.log("Connected to server.");

    // Send client events over the WebSocket once connected
    ws.send(
        JSON.stringify({
            type: "session.update",
            session: {
                type: "realtime",
                instructions: "Be extra nice today!",
            },
        })
    );
});

// Listen for and parse server events
ws.on("message", function incoming(message) {
    console.log(JSON.parse(message.toString()));
});
```

In this way, you are able to add tools, monitor sessions, and carry out business logic on the server instead of needing to configure those actions on the client.

### With SIP

1.  A user connects to OpenAI via phone over SIP.
2.  OpenAI sends a webhook to your application’s backend webhook URL, notifying your app of the state of the session. The webhook will look something like:

```json
POST https://my_website.com/webhook_endpoint
user-agent: OpenAI/1.0 (+https://platform.openai.com/docs/webhooks)
content-type: application/json
webhook-id: wh_685342e6c53c8190a1be43f081506c52 # unique id for idempotency
webhook-timestamp: 1750287078 # timestamp of delivery attempt
webhook-signature: v1,K5oZfzN95Z9UVu1EsfQmfVNQhnkZ2pj9o9NDN/H/pI4= # signature to verify authenticity from OpenAI

{
  "object": "event",
  "id": "evt_685343a1381c819085d44c354e1b330e",
  "type": "realtime.call.incoming",
  "created_at": 1750287018, // Unix timestamp
  "data": {
    "call_id": "some_unique_id",
    "sip_headers": [
      { "name": "From", "value": "sip:+142555512112@sip.example.com" },
      { "name": "To", "value": "sip:+18005551212@sip.example.com" },
      { "name": "Call-ID", "value": "03782086-4ce9-44bf-8b0d-4e303d2cc590"}
    ]
  }
}
```

3.  The application server opens a WebSocket connection to the Realtime API using the `call_id` value provided in the webhook, via a URL like this: `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?call_id={callId}`. The WebSocket connection will live for the life of the SIP call.

The WebSocket connection can then be used to send and receive events to control the call, just as you would if the session was initiated with a WebSocket connection. This includes monitoring the call, updating instructions dynamically, and responding to tool calls.

Managing costs
==============

Understanding and managing token costs with the Realtime API.

This document describes how Realtime API billing works and offer strategies for optimizing costs. Costs are accrued as input and output tokens of different modalities: text, audio, and image. Token costs vary per model, with prices listed on the model pages (e.g. for [`gpt-realtime`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-realtime) and [`gpt-realtime-mini`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-realtime-mini)).

Conversational Realtime API sessions are a series of _turns_, where the user adds input that triggers a _Response_ to produce the model output. The server maintains a _Conversation_, which is a list of _Items_ that form the input for the next turn. When a Response is returned the output is automatically added to the Conversation.

Per-Response costs
------------------

Realtime API costs are accrued when a Response is created, and is charged based on the numbers of input and output tokens (except for input transcription costs, see below). There is no cost currently for network bandwidth or connections. A Response can be created manually or automatically if voice activity detection (VAD) is turned on. VAD will effectively filter out empty input audio, so empty audio does not count as input tokens unless the client manually adds it as conversation input.

The entire conversation is sent to the model for each Response. The output from a turn will be added as Items to the server Conversation and become the input to subsequent turns, thus turns later in the session will be more expensive.

Text token costs can be estimated using our [tokenization tools](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer). Audio tokens in user messages are 1 token per 100 ms of audio, while audio tokens in assistant messages are 1 token per 50ms of audio. Note that token counts include special tokens aside from the content of a message which will surface as small variations in these counts, for example a user message with 10 text tokens of content may count as 12 tokens.

### Example

Here’s a simple example to illustrate token costs over a multi-turn Realtime API session.

For the first turn in the conversation we’ve added 100 tokens of instructions, a user message of 20 audio tokens (for example added by VAD based on the user speaking), for a total of 120 input tokens. Creating a Response generates an assistant output message (20 audio, 10 text tokens).

Then we create a second turn with another user audio message. What will the tokens for turn 2 look like? The Conversation at this point includes the initial instructions, first user message, the output assistant message from the first turn, plus the second user message (25 audio tokens). This turn will have 110 text and 64 audio tokens for input, plus the output tokens of another assistant output message.

![tokens on successive conversation turns](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/realtime-costs-turns.png)

The messages from the first turn are likely to be cached for turn 2, which reduces the input cost. See below for more information on caching.

The tokens used for a Response can be read from the `response.done` event, which looks like the following.

```json
{
  "type": "response.done",
  "response": {
    ...
    "usage": {
      "total_tokens": 253,
      "input_tokens": 132,
      "output_tokens": 121,
      "input_token_details": {
        "text_tokens": 119,
        "audio_tokens": 13,
        "image_tokens": 0,
        "cached_tokens": 64,
        "cached_tokens_details": {
          "text_tokens": 64,
          "audio_tokens": 0,
          "image_tokens": 0
        }
      },
      "output_token_details": {
        "text_tokens": 30,
        "audio_tokens": 91
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Input transcription costs
-------------------------

Aside from conversational Responses, the Realtime API bills for input transcriptions, if enabled. Input transcription uses a different model than the speech2speech model, such as [`whisper-1`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper-1) or [`gpt-4o-transcribe`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-transcribe), and thus are billed from a different rate card. Transcription is performed when audio is written to the input audio buffer and then committed, either manually or by VAD.

Input transcription token counts can be read from the `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` event, as in the following example.

```json
{
  "type": "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed",
  ...
  "transcript": "Hi, can you hear me?",
  "usage": {
    "type": "tokens",
    "total_tokens": 26,
    "input_tokens": 17,
    "input_token_details": {
      "text_tokens": 0,
      "audio_tokens": 17
    },
    "output_tokens": 9
  }
}
```

Caching
-------

Realtime API supports [prompt caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching), which is applied automatically and can dramatically reduce the costs of input tokens during multi-turn sessions. Caching applies when the input tokens of a Response match tokens from a previous Response, though this is best-effort and not guaranteed.

The best strategy for maximizing cache rate is keep a session’s history static. Removing or changing content in the conversation will “bust” the cache up to the point of the change — the input no longer matches as much as before. Note that instructions and tool definitions are at the beginning of a conversation, thus changing these mid-session will reduce the cache rate for subsequent turns.

Truncation
----------

When the number of tokens in a conversation exceeds the model's input token limit the conversation be truncated, meaning messages (starting from the oldest) will be dropped from the Response input. A 32k context model with 4,096 max output tokens can only include 28,224 tokens in the context before truncation occurs.

Clients can set a smaller token window than the model’s maximum, which is a good way to control token usage and cost. This is controlled with the `token_limits.post_instructions` configuration (if you configure truncation with a `retention_ratio` type as shown below). As the name indicates, this controls the maximum number of input tokens for a Response, except for the instruction tokens. Setting `post_instructions` to 1,000 means that items over the 1,000 input token limit will not be sent to the model for a Response.

Truncation busts the cache near the beginning of the conversation, and if truncation occurs on every turn then cache rate will be very low. To mitigate this issue clients can configure truncation to drop more messages than necessary, which will extend the headroom before another truncation is needed. This can be controlled with the `session.truncation.retention_ratio` setting. The server defaults to a value of `1.0` , meaning truncation will remove only the items necessary. A value of `0.8` means a truncation would retain 80% of the maximum, dropping an additional 20%.

If you’re attempting to reduce Realtime API cost per session (for a given model), we recommend reducing limiting the number of tokens and setting a `retention_ratio` less than 1, as in the following example. Remember that there may be a tradeoff here in terms of lower cost but lower model memory for a given turn.

```json
{
  "event": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "truncation": {
      "type": "retention_ratio",
      "retention_ratio": 0.8,
      "token_limits": {
        "post_instructions": 8000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Truncation can also be completely disabled, as shown below. When disabled an error will be returned if the Conversation is too long to create a Response. This may be useful if you intend to manage the Conversation size manually.

```json
{
  "event": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "truncation": "disabled"
  }
}
```

Other optimization strategies
-----------------------------

### Using a mini model

The Realtime speech2speech models come in a “normal” size and a mini size, which is significantly cheaper. The tradeoff here tends to be intelligence related to instruction following and function calling, which will not be as effective in the mini model. We recommend first testing applications with the larger model, refining your application and prompt, then attempting to optimize using the mini model.

### Editing the Conversation

While truncation will occur automatically on the server, another cost management strategy is to manually edit the Conversation. A principle of the API is to allow full client control of the server-side Conversation, allowing the client to add and remove items at will.

```json
{
	"type": "conversation.item.delete",
	"item_id": "item_CCXLecNJVIVR2HUy3ABLj"
}
```

Clearing out old messages is a good way to reduce input token sizes and cost. This might remove important content, but a common strategy is to replace these old messages with a summary. Items can be deleted from the Conversation with a `conversation.item.delete` message as above, and can be added with a `conversation.item.create` message.

Estimating costs
----------------

Given the complexity in Realtime API token usage it can be difficult to estimate your costs ahead of time. A good approach is to use the Realtime Playground with your intended prompts and functions, and measure the token usage over a sample session. The token usage for a session can be found under the Logs tab in the Realtime Playground next to the session id.

![showing tokens in the playground](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/realtime-playground-tokens.png)

Realtime transcription
======================

Learn how to transcribe audio in real-time with the Realtime API.

You can use the Realtime API for transcription-only use cases, either with input from a microphone or from a file. For example, you can use it to generate subtitles or transcripts in real-time. With the transcription-only mode, the model will not generate responses.

If you want the model to produce responses, you can use the Realtime API in [speech-to-speech conversation mode](/docs/guides/realtime-conversations).

Realtime transcription sessions
-------------------------------

To use the Realtime API for transcription, you need to create a transcription session, connecting via [WebSockets](/docs/guides/realtime?use-case=transcription#connect-with-websockets) or [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime?use-case=transcription#connect-with-webrtc).

Unlike the regular Realtime API sessions for conversations, the transcription sessions typically don't contain responses from the model.

The transcription session object uses the same base session shape, but it always has a `type` of `"transcription"`:

```json
{
  "object": "realtime.session",
  "type": "transcription",
  "id": "session_abc123",
  "audio": {
    "input": {
      "format": {
        "type": "audio/pcm",
        "rate": 24000
      },
      "noise_reduction": {
        "type": "near_field"
      },
      "transcription": {
        "model": "gpt-4o-transcribe",
        "prompt": "",
        "language": "en"
      },
      "turn_detection": {
        "type": "server_vad",
        "threshold": 0.5,
        "prefix_padding_ms": 300,
        "silence_duration_ms": 500
      }
    }
  },
  "include": [
    "item.input_audio_transcription.logprobs"
  ]
}
```

### Session fields

*   `type`: Always `transcription` for realtime transcription sessions.
*   `audio.input.format`: Input encoding for audio that you append to the buffer. Supported types are:
    *   `audio/pcm` (24 kHz mono PCM; only a `rate` of `24000` is supported).
    *   `audio/pcmu` (G.711 μ-law).
    *   `audio/pcma` (G.711 A-law).
*   `audio.input.noise_reduction`: Optional noise reduction that runs before VAD and turn detection. Use `{ "type": "near_field" }`, `{ "type": "far_field" }`, or `null` to disable.
*   `audio.input.transcription`: Optional asynchronous transcription of input audio. Supply:
    *   `model`: One of `whisper-1`, `gpt-4o-transcribe-latest`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, or `gpt-4o-transcribe`.
    *   `language`: ISO-639-1 code such as `en`.
    *   `prompt`: Prompt text or keyword list (model-dependent) that guides the transcription output.
*   `audio.input.turn_detection`: Optional automatic voice activity detection (VAD). Set to `null` to manage turn boundaries manually. For `server_vad`, you can tune `threshold`, `prefix_padding_ms`, `silence_duration_ms`, `interrupt_response`, `create_response`, and `idle_timeout_ms`. For `semantic_vad`, configure `eagerness`, `interrupt_response`, and `create_response`.
*   `include`: Optional list of additional fields to stream back on events (for example `item.input_audio_transcription.logprobs`).

You can find more information about the transcription session object in the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions/transcription_session_object).

Handling transcriptions
-----------------------

When using the Realtime API for transcription, you can listen for the `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta` and `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` events.

For `whisper-1` the `delta` event will contain full turn transcript, same as `completed` event. For `gpt-4o-transcribe` and `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` the `delta` event will contain incremental transcripts as they are streamed out from the model.

Here is an example transcription delta event:

```json
{
  "event_id": "event_2122",
  "type": "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta",
  "item_id": "item_003",
  "content_index": 0,
  "delta": "Hello,"
}
```

Here is an example transcription completion event:

```json
{
  "event_id": "event_2122",
  "type": "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed",
  "item_id": "item_003",
  "content_index": 0,
  "transcript": "Hello, how are you?"
}
```

Note that ordering between completion events from different speech turns is not guaranteed. You should use `item_id` to match these events to the `input_audio_buffer.committed` events and use `input_audio_buffer.committed.previous_item_id` to handle the ordering.

To send audio data to the transcription session, you can use the `input_audio_buffer.append` event.

You have 2 options:

*   Use a streaming microphone input
*   Stream data from a wav file

Voice activity detection
------------------------

The Realtime API supports automatic voice activity detection (VAD). Enabled by default, VAD will control when the input audio buffer is committed, therefore when transcription begins.

Read more about configuring VAD in our [Voice Activity Detection](/docs/guides/realtime-vad) guide.

You can also disable VAD by setting the `audio.input.turn_detection` property to `null`, and control when to commit the input audio on your end.

Additional configurations
-------------------------

### Noise reduction

Use the `audio.input.noise_reduction` property to configure how to handle noise reduction in the audio stream.

*   `{ "type": "near_field" }`: Use near-field noise reduction (default).
*   `{ "type": "far_field" }`: Use far-field noise reduction.
*   `null`: Disable noise reduction.

### Using logprobs

You can use the `include` property to include logprobs in the transcription events, using `item.input_audio_transcription.logprobs`.

Those logprobs can be used to calculate the confidence score of the transcription.

```json
{
  "type": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "audio": {
      "input": {
        "format": {
          "type": "audio/pcm",
          "rate": 24000
        },
        "transcription": {
          "model": "gpt-4o-transcribe"
        },
        "turn_detection": {
          "type": "server_vad",
          "threshold": 0.5,
          "prefix_padding_ms": 300,
          "silence_duration_ms": 500
        }
      }
    },
    "include": [
      "item.input_audio_transcription.logprobs"
    ]
  }
}
```
